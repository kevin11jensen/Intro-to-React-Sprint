1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    React JS is considered a 'JavaScript library for building user interfaces.' The magic of React is that it creates a virtual DOM that interacts with state management which allows for the browser to not have to re-render the entire DOM with each user interaction with the browser. Instead the app is broken down into smaller components that can have their own state saving lots of computing power.

1. Describe component state.
    State describes data that changes. In it's most basic form you set an initial state and declare a variable that is used to store the change in data.

1. Describe props.
   Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
